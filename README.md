# Thursday 2-12-25 preparation:
What is our digital history/humanities method:
 ** Medium:** podcast/video essay 
 ** Method potentials:**
 
  - Digital collection set 
  - Timeline
  -  ~~- Network Analysis (?)~~

**Sources, Info, Data that we have found and/or want to create:**

  - https://mises.org/power-market/how-west-was-won-counterinsurgency-psyops-and-military-origins-internet-part-i-look-gift-horse-mouth 
  - https://jsou.edu/Press/PublicationDashboard/256

**The significance of our proposed topic:**

  - Philosophical Significance: The U.S. government has long since played a massive role in constructing the collective perception of reality in America, both politically and     metaphysically. Understanding the direct initiatives involved in such cultivation is an invaluable resource for the general public. 
  - Our first episode will provide source and discussion platforms to engage with data concerning the government’s intentional constructions perception through psychological operations/MISO. 
        - Enmesh specific Historical significance*^
  - Our PBS will provide a platform to engage with relevant topics that combine….. Work on this
 
 
 
 
# PSYOPtics: Psychological Operations and the Formation of American Reality
**Sunday 2-15-26**

**By: Ananya Burman and Syd Davis**

Working Research Question:
The working questions which will drive the Video Essay episode, and preceding Resource Collection are: How have domestic CIA Psychological Operations impacted not just the shared memory of American citizens, but American reality at large? How has PSYOP evolved through time following the digital revolution? How has this evolution worked to enforce or reinforce earlier narratives? 

For our digital history project, we will be creating a Public Broadcasting Network which will host video essays, research, and collections, with a platform intended to actualize accessibility, viewer engagement, and discussion. Our first Episode, and primary aspect of the project, will be a video essay presented with a curated digital collection and discussion board. The Public Broadcasting Network will be a static site, hosting various collections, episodes, and discussions aimed at educating viewers on the critical analysis of history and historical production. With a focus on a sustainable, transparent mode of historical, philosophical, and political documentation and scholarship, the network is intended to become a longstanding interface that continues on outside of the course and develops through collaboration and engagement.

The first episode of the series, titled “PSYOPtics: Psychological Operations and the American Imagination,” will investigate the CIA’s Psychological-operations program, analyzing how the operations worked with, and altered public imagination related to capitalism and the American Dream. This episode will provide a brief origin of PSYOP, beginning with its earliest military uses during World War I, to understand the three strands of psychological operations that shaped the birth of the modern PSYOP program. Following this, we will pinpoint three distinct historical moments and the psychological operations that follow them. The periods under investigation are: Cold War operations (1947-1991), Post-Cold War operations (roughly 1990-2008), concluding with an analysis of PSYOP in the age of the internet (2010-present). In analyzing these moments in time and their relationships to PSYOP, we hope to develop a space for critical analysis of history, politics, and American memory. Covert programs developed by the United States government have long since played a role in the construction of the domestic collective perception of reality in America, both politically and metaphysically. Understanding the direct initiatives involved in such cultivation is an invaluable resource for the general public. 

The Primary Resources used to create “PSYOPtics” will be exhibited through a digital collection of documents pertaining to the development of what is now known as Military Information Support Operations (MISO). This collection will have all documents viewable in their original form, with additional labeling provided for additional context on the origins and meaning of the document, the retrieval of the document, and a brief explanation of the decision to include it in the collection. This collection space will also include a transparency claus,e which expresses an understanding of how positionality impacts the historian's work while collecting and researching a topic. In providing this transparency to the site's viewers, we are also working toward broader mission goals of educating viewers on the importance of critical analysis. All additional episodes on the site will incorporate a resource collection specific to the episode topic, as well as a discussion platform to engage with the data. The broader format of the public broadcasting network will provide a space for viewers to interact with the digital collection, discuss with others (as well as with “us”), and more intimately engage with the material at hand.


We will be working with various digital tools involved in both the interface and contents of the first episode. The Public Broadcasting network will be a static site, generated through Jekyll, hosted and edited through the Github platform. Our digital collection will be built and incorporated through CollectionBuilder, an open source framework that uses Jekyll to facilitate the generation of a more formal Digital Collection of, in this case, documents and artifacts concerning various progressions, processes, and impacts of formal American Psychological Operations. We will inevitably be using Google Spreadsheets in order to organize and facilitate our ‘metadata’ into CollectionBuilder. We will embark on compiling various government, military, foreign, and civilian documents to showcase the various factors of psychological operations through the significant eras of progression, allowing for an accessible, yet focused visualization of psychological operations in America.
