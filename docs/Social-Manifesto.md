# "REMEMBER, WE MAY ONLY KNOW THE ACTUAL THROUGH CONTRAST WITH, OR LIKENING TO, THE IMAGINABLE."

# - Hayden White

1. Strive for transparency and accessibility

2. Continually look for the gaps and silences in the scholarship we share

3. Welcome discourse between the user and the collection

4. Promote positionality in knowledge production
